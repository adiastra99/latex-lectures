## latex-lectures

This repo provides .cls files for the use of LaTeX in lecture notes and homework. `lec.cls` and `hw.cls` provide the classes to be directly used in `\documentclass{...}`, and `custom.sty` provides shortcuts common to both of them. `latex-lectures` supports splitting lectures into a subfile for each lecture, which can be compiled individually or all together; a suggested project structure is under `/examples`.

The lecture format is adapted from a template used in UC Berkeley's CS 267, Applications of Parallel Computing.
